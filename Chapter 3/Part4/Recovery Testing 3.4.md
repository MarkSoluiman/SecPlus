Organizations should test themselves before an actual event through scheduled update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc.)

Use well-defined rules of engagement. Testings must not touch the production systems. Testing should be done on very specific scenarios with limited time to run the event. The response should be evaluated by documentation.

## Tabletop Exercises

Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly and time consuming. 

Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis only so organizations don't physically have to go through a disaster or drill.

## Simulation

Test with a simulated event like phishing attacks, password requests, data breaches, etc.
