## Server Clustering

Combine two or more servers. This will easily increase capacity and availability. These servers will share one shared storage to be up to date and synchronized with each other. 

## Site Resiliency 

Organizations can have sites which are dedicated to recovery. When a disaster happen, all of the servers and data will run in the recovery site. When the disaster is over, revert back to the primary location. The process must be documented for both directions. 

## Hot Site

A hot site is an exact replica of a data center. 

##  Cold Site

A cold site doesn't have hardware (empty warehouse).

## Warm Site

Somewhere between cold and hot site. It contains some of the hardware and some of the data. 

## Geographic dispersion

These sites should be physically different than the organization's primary location. Many disruptions can affect a large area like hurricanes, tornados, floods, etc.  

## Platform Diversity

Organizations should rely on different OSs for their devices. If the organization gets targeted by a specific OS exploit, not every device within the organization will be affected. 

## Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP)

When things get wrong, organizations need to think of alternative ways to keep the business going: manual transactions, paper receipts, phone calls for transactions approvals, etc.
