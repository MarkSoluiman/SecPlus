## Security Zones  

Security zones allow us to logically separate all of the device on a network by their user or their access type. Each section of the network will be assigned a zone. For example, we might have a trusted and an untrusted zone, an internal and an external zone, and other types of zones like inside, servers, databases, etc. 

Zones simplify security policies.

## Attack Surface

Attack surfaces are the ways an attacker can get access to the organization's network and cause harm: through application code, open ports, authentication process , or human error. 

We can minimize the surface by audit the code, block ports on the firewall, monitor network traffic in real-time. 

## Connectivity

It's important to secure the connection between the devices in a network. We can secure the network cabling by protecting the physical drops, apply application-level encryption. Apply network-level encryption by IPsec tunnels, VPN connections
