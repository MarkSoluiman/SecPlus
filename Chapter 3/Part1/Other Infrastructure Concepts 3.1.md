## On-Premises Security

The user have full control of the servers in-house. The on-site It team can manage security better. However, a local it team can be expensive and difficult to staff. 

System checks can happen at any time. However, security changes can take time to install new equipment, configurations. 

## Centralized Vs. Decentralized

Most organizations are physically decentralized. They have many locations, multiple cloud providers, multiple operating systems, etc.

This is more difficult to manage and protect so many diverse systems. 

To solve this problem, IT professionals take a centralized approach like correlated alerts, consolidated log file analysis, comprehensive system status and maintenance/patching.

However, this is not ideal as this will have a single point of failure. 

## Virtualization 

This refers to running many different OSs on the same hardware. 

## Application Containerization 

A container contains everything the user need to run an application. It has code and dependencies. 

Every container is isolated from each other. each application can only see its resources and dependencies and it can't interact with any other containers running other applications.

## SCADA / ICS

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System aka Industrial Control Systems (ICS).

This is used in factories with power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment.

It provides real-time information for all of the equipment and systems.

## RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)

An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule. No time to wait for other processes. This can be found in industrial equipment, automobiles, and military environments.
