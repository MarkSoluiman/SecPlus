## Availability

It is important to have the system or application available for a long period of time. Availability is measured by the percentage of available time. The higher the percentage, the better the availability. 

## Resilience

Eventually, something will happen. Resilience is about the ability to maintain availability and to recover quickly. This is measured with **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)** which measures the time to repair/replace unavailable components with available ones. 

## Responsiveness

When information is requested, response is sent back. How quickly did that take?

## Scalability

How quickly and easily can we increase or decrease capacity? This is called elasticity.

## Ease of Deployment 

Cloud based systems or applications are easy to deploy using orchestration.

## Risk Transference

Many methods to minimize risk. Transfer the risk to a third-party.

Have a cybersecurity insurance when things go wrong. This will cover attacks and downtime.

## Ease of Recovery

There should be a plan on how to recover. This plan should be as efficient as possible.

For example, in case of a malware infection, to reload the operating system from the original media this will take one hour. However, reloading an image of the OS will only take ten minutes.
