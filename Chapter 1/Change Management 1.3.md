## Change Approval Process

This is a formal process for managing change to avoid downtime, confusion, and mistakes.

Before a change is made, a change approval process must be followed: complete he request forms. Determine the purpose of the change. Identify the scope of the change. Schedule a date and time of the change. Determine affected systems and the impact. Analyze the risk associated with the change. Get approval from the change control board. Get end-user acceptance after the change is complete.

## Ownership

The person or entity who owns the process needs to make the change or make the decision to make the change. 

For example, address label printers need to be upgraded. Shipping and Receiving department owns the process. IT handles the actual change.

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders are the individuals or entities who the are impacted by the change.

For example, upgrade software used for shipping labels will affect the Shipping / Receiving, accounting reports, product delivery time frames, and revenue recognition which must be known to the CEO of the company.

## Impact Analysis

This requires to determine a risk value: high, medium, low.

The risks can be minor or far-reaching: The fix doesn't actually fix anything. The fix breaks something else. Operating system failures. Data corruption.

We need also to determine the risk of not making a change: Security vulnerability. Application unavailability. Unexpected downtime or other services.

## Testing Results

Before performing changes on the production environment, a sandbox environment should be used for testing. This environment shouldn't be connected to the real world or production system.

There must be a backup plan. If something went wrong in production, we can move everything back to the original state.

## Maintenance Window

This is to determine when the best time to perform the change.
