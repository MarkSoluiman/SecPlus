The CIA triad is a combination of principles: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. 
These are the fundamentals of security and sometimes can be referred to as the AIC Triad.

### Confidentiality

- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems.
### Integrity

- Messages can't be modified without detection.
### Availability 

- Systems and networks must be up and running.

In **confidentiality**, certain information should only be know to certain people. We can do that by: 
### Encryption

- We encode messages so only certain people can read it.

### Access Controls

- Selectively restrict access to a resource.

### Two-Factor Authentication

- Additional confirmation before information is disclosed.


In **Integrity**, data is stored and transferred as intended. Any modification to the data would be identified. We can do that by:
### Hashing

- Map data of an arbitrary length to data of a fixed length.
### Digital Signatures

- Mathematical scheme to verify the integrity of data.
### Certificates 

- Combine with a digital signature to verify an individual.
### Non-Repudiation

- Provides proof of integrity, can be asserted to be genuine.

In **Availability**, information is accessible to authorized users. This can be done by:

### Redundancy

- Build services that will always be available.
### Fault Tolerance

- System will continue to run, even when failure occurs.

### Patching 

- Stability 
- Close security holes
