**Gap analysis is to compare where we are and where we want to be in the future.**

This might take weeks or months to research what aspects the organization is short in and how to improve the security situation of the organization.

Organizations need to work towards a known baseline. This may be an internal set or goals.

Organizations might choose to have a framework to follow like the NIST framework or ISO 27001.

To start the gap analysis: **Comparison** which is to evaluate existing systems. **Identify weaknesses**. **Detailed analyses** where broad security categories are examined and these are broken into smaller segments.

Finally, organizations achieve the final comparison report which includes detailed baseline objectives and a clear view of the current state.
