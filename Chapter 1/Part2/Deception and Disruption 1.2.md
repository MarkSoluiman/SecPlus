## Honeypots

Honeypots attract attackers and trap them there.

Honeypots are virtual environments act like the real environment that the organization is in.  

Honeypots are not just one device. They should consist of servers, workstations, routers, switches, firewalls, etc.

**Honeynets** are environments within one big honeypot.

## Honeyfiles

These are fake files with fake info.
They may have names that attract attacks like passwords or credentials.

An alert is sent if the files is access which is a **virtual bear trap**.

## Honeytokens 

This is to track malicious actors.
Add some traceable data to the honeypot. If the data is stolen, we will know where it came from.

For example, fake API credentials might be added. These credentials don't provide access to anything but notifications will be sent when used. This also can be applied to emails. If one of these emails appeared in the public, we will be able to know who is attacking our network.
