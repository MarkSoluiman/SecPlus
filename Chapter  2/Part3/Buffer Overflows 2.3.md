Buffer overflows is when a process starts to leak memory into other memory areas due to the exceeding of the size of data provided for that process.

This is not a simple exploit to perform. It takes time to figure out the right amount of data to avoid crashing the system, and it takes time to provide the right type of data for the exploit to work.
