## Keyloggers

Keyloggers send every keystroke to the attacker. Keyloggers can also do: clipboard logging, screen logging, etc. 

## Logic Bomb

logic bomb waits for an even to occur, and when it occurs, the bomb is detonated doing something in the system. For example, a time bomb will wait for a specific time or date to be activated. A user event bomb will go off when the user does something like logging in. 

It is difficult to prevent a logic bomb. However, an alert on changes might be useful to detect a logic bomb.

## Rootkits

Rootkits modify core system files. They can be invisible to the operating system. They are also invisible to traditional anti-virus softwares.

To remove a rootkit, specific rootkit removers can be used that can detect specific rootkits. 
Another way to stop rootkits from running is to boot the device in secure boot mode. Secure boot will look for an operating system signature and confirm that nothing has changed with the kernel of that operating system before the system is booted.
