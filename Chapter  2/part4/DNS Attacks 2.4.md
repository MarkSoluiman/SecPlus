## DNS Spoofing / Poisoning 

DNS poising happens when an attacker changes the IP address that is linked to a website a user visits to his/her IP address. This is done by the attacker first gaining access to the DNS server and modifying the IP address there. The user will instead visit the attacker's IP address instead of the actual website  IP address. 

## Domain Hijacking

Another way of DNS attacks is domain hijacking. The attacker gets access to the domain registration, and they will have control where the traffic flows. The attacker doesn't have to touch the DNS servers since the registration determines the DNS names and DNS IP addresses. 

## URL Hijacking

An attacker might own a misspelled website name and they can use that in multiple of ways, like to sell this misspelled  URL to the actual owner of the website, or to use this fake website to act as the real one to steal user's info.
