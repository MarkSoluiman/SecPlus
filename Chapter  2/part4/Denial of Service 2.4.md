## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

An attacker will launch an army of computers to bring down a service. This is done by overwhelming a network with so much traffic causing servers to slow down or shutdown entirely.

DDoS amplification happens when attackers send small amount of data that return much larger data and reflects the output back to server(s). This is done by protocols that require little authentication or checks like: NTP, DNS, ICMP.
