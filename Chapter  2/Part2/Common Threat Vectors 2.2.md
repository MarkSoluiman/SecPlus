## Message-Based Vectors

One of the biggest and most successful threat vectors. Everyone has as least one of messaging systems.

Attackers can target emails addresses by malicious links in an email or a link to a malicious site.

Attackers can also use SMSs to ask for info or to put malicious links.

These attacks are called **Phishing attacks**

Social engineering attacks rely on attackers gaining their targets' trust. Attackers can convince their victims that they are from a legit organization and start asking them for sensitive info that they shouldn't share, click on malicious links, or even sending money for multiple of reasons.

## Image-Based Vectors

Text-based threats are relatively easy to identify as such. However, it is much harder to identify image-based vectors as threats. 

One of the image formats that can be used in such attacks are **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic)**. The image in this format is described in XML. This brings a significant security concerns since an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.

## File-Based Vectors

Not only executable files would act as a threat vector, other files like PDFs or ZIPs might contain malicious codes within them.  

## Voice Call Vectors

Another form of social engineering attacks is **Vishing (Phishing over the  phone)**. 
Attackers might use Spam over IP to constantly change their phone number to avoid being blocked. 

## Removable Device Vectors

Malicious software can be installed on USB drive and will ran automatically once this USB stick is connected to a device. This attack can target air gapped network or devices (not connected to the outer network). 

USB drives can act as a keyboard. Attackers can have remote access to a device and type malicious code.

## Vulnerable Software Vectors

Constant updates for softwares will fix vulnerabilities that attackers can use to attack devices or networks.

Devices don't always have to have installed vulnerable softwares to be infected. If a server is vulnerable by a vulnerable software, every device that is connected to that server can be targeted. This is an **Agentless** attack.  

## Unsupported Systems Vectors

Outdated Operating systems or softwares might act as a risk. These operating systems and softwares are not getting any further support and patches from the manufacturer. It is important to keen an inventory and records up to date. 

## Unsecure Network Vectors

If an attacker managed to access your network, the attacker will have access to the traffic and device within your organization. An attacker might access a Wi-Fi network that uses an outdated security protocols like WEP, WPA, WPA2 .

When it comes to wired network, 802.1X protocol should be enabled to only gain access to the network with valid credentials. 

## Open Service Ports

Most network-based services connect over TCP or UDP ports. Every open port is an opportunity for the attacker to gain access through a vulnerability or misconfigurations. 

The more services on your device that are connected to the network, the bigger the attack surface would be.

Firewalls must be used to limit the surface of attack.

## Default Credentials

Always change the default credentials of any software or hardware that is being used.

## Supply Chain Vectors

Tampering to hardware might have happened to a device during manufacturing or after manufacturing
