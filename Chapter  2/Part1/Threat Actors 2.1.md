Attackers can be **internal** (within the organization), or **external**.

It is useful to determine the resources/funding and level of sophistication/capability the attacker(s) have when acting against an organization. 

Attackers might have different reasons for attacking an organization. For example, when two nations are at war with each other, a cyber war might start and both nations will attack each other's network.

Nations will perform constant attacks with massive resources. This is called **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**.

On the other side of the spectrum of how sophisticated attackers can get, we will have an unskilled attackers who run scripts without knowing what is really happening in the background.
