The security of an application environment should be well defined. All application instances must follow this baseline. For example, firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions. May required constant updates.

Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline. These should be performed often. Check against well- documented baselines. Failure requires an immediate correction. 

## Establish Baselines

Fortunately, security baselines are often available from the manufacturer. Organizations can make changes on these baselines to meet their requirements. 

Many OSs have extensive options. There are over 3,000 group policy settings in Win10.
Only some of those are associated with security.

## Deploy Baselines

Usually managed through a centrally administered console. May require multiple deployment mechanisms like active directory group policy, MDM (Mobile Device Management), etc.

## Maintain Baselines 

Many of the already existing baselines are best practices and they rarely change. However, other baselines may require ongoing updates. For example, a new vulnerability is discovered. An updated application has been deployed. A new operating system is installed.

Sometimes, some baselines may contradict others. Test and measure to avoid conflicts.
