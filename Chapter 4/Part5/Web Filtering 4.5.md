## Content Filtering 

Control traffic based on data within the content. This is done by URL filtering, website category filtering, etc.

Sometimes these filters are designed to control what data is going out and what data is coming in. 

These filters can also be used to filter inappropriate content like not safe for work websites. 

Obviously, filters can also be used to protect against viruses and malware. 

## Agent Based

This is an installed software on the user's device that can filter content based on URL and other categories. That means users don't have to be connected to a specific firewall or a router for the filtering of content to take place. Users can connect from any where.

Updates must be distributed to all agents installed on every device. This calls for cloud-based updates. 

## Reputation

Filters URLs based on perceived risk. A good reputation website is a allowed while a website with a bad reputation is blocked. There are different levels of reputation: trustworthy, low risk, medium risk, suspicious, high risk.

## DNS Filtering 

There are many domain names that are known to have questionable content or may contain malicious code. In those cases, we can configure the DNS to not provide the user with the IP address of that website. The DNS is updated automatically with real-time threat intelligence.
