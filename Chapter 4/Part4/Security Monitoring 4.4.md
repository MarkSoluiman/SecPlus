## Monitoring Computing Resources

Systems monitoring include:
- Authentication - login from strange places.
- Server monitoring - service activity, backups, software versions.

Applications monitoring:
- Availability - up-time and response times.
- Data transfers - increases or decreases in rates.
- Security notifications - from the developer / manufacturer.

Infrastructure monitoring:
- Remote access systems - Employees, vendors, guests.
- Firewall and IPS reports - increase or type of attack.

## Scanning

Organizations should actively check systems and devices. For example, operating system types and versions, device driver versions, installed applications, potential anomalies, etc. 

## Reporting

Ad hoc information summaries is a report that helps organizations to plan for the unknown. For example, an organization may have an OS  in their environment and they know this OS will reach the end of life in about six months. The question will be, when that period is up, how many systems will be susceptible to vulnerabilities .

## Alerting 

It would be useful to get a real-time alert when an anomaly is discovered like increase in authentication errors or large file transfers.

## Alert Response and Remediation

Quarantine is a foundational security response. It prevents a potential security issue from spreading. 

The challenge is to tune the alerts to prevent false positives and false negatives as much as we can.
