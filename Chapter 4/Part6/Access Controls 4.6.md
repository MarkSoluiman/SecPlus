## Mandatory Access Control (MAC)

The OS limits the operation on an object. Every object gets a label:Confidential, secret, top secret,etc. 

Labeling of objects uses predefined rules. The administrator decides who gets access to what security level. 

## Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

The user who created the data, has control on who can access the data.
Very flexible and less secure.

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Administrators provide access to users based on their roles in the organization.

In Windows, Groups are used to provide role-based access control. 

## Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)

Users can have complex relationships to applications and data. Access may be based on many different criteria. 

This can be considered as next generation authorization model. It uses different parameters: resource information, IP address, time of day, desired action, relationship to the data, etc.
