Increase the password entropy by increasing its complexity. 

## Password Age and Expiration

Password age measures how long since the password was changed. Password expiration determines the period of time that password can be used for. 

## Password Managers

Password managers should be used to store complex different passwords in one safe place. 

## Passwordless Authentication

Some systems don't use passwords to authenticate like face ID in mobile phones.
