## Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)

Send random input to an application. Referred to as fault-injection, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing.

Looking for something out of the ordinary like application crash, server error, exception, etc. 

## Package Monitoring

Some applications are distributed in a package.

Confirm the package is legitimate and came from trusted source with no added malware or no embedded vulnerabilities.
