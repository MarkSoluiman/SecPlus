## Patching

This is the most common mitigation technique.

## Insurance

Covers loss related to cyber attacks like lost revenue, data recovery costs, money lost to phishing, etc.

## Segmentation 

Limit the scope of an exploit by separating devices into their own networks/VLANs for example. 

If patching on a system is not possible, air gap may be required.

Use internal NGFWs to block unwanted or unnecessary traffic between VLANs and to identify malicious traffic on the inside.

## Compensating Controls

Optimal security methods may not be available due to different reasons like can't deploy a patch right now or no internal firewalls.

Organizations can compensate in other ways:
- Disable the problematic service.
- Revoke access to the application.
- Limit external access.
- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls.

## Exceptions and Exemptions

If for an example a database server will be affected by a patch (will go offline for sometime). A decision can be made to not patch the server as it is extremely difficult to exploit the server (can only be exploited internally or require physical access). That decision usually is taken after a formal process.

## Validation of Remediation

After the vulnerability has been patched, organizations should perform an extensive vulnerability scan.

## Reporting

Ongoing checks are required as new vulnerabilities are continuously discovered. 

The reporting should include:
- Number of identified vulnerabilities.
- Systems patched vs. unpatched.
- New threat notifications.
- Errors, exceptions, and exemptions.
