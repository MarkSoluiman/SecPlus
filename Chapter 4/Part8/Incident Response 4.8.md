## Preparing for an Incident

There should be a list of communication methods. Phones and contact information.

Incident handling hardware and software like laptops, removable media, forensic software, digital cameras, etc. These must be available and on hand in case of an incident. This along side with incident analysis resources like documentation, network diagrams, baselines, etc.

Incident mitigation software. There should be clean OS and application images. 

Policies needed for incident handling should be known and taught. 

## The Challenge of Detection

Attacks are coming at all times. How to identify the legitimate threats is crucial and require extensive knowledge. 

## Analysis

A history of previous attacks might be useful to look at to know where most of the previous attacks have been originated from and what kind of attacks they were.

Always keep an eye on the monthly updates from Microsoft and other softwares updates to keep up with the most secure versions of OS and applications that an organization has.

## Isolation and Containment

A sandbox which is an isolated device can be used to test and analyse applications or even malwares to see how they would behave. 

## Recovery After an Incident

Remove the malware, disable breached user accounts, fix vulnerabilities, etc.

Restore from backups, rebuild from scratch, replace compromised files, tighten down the perimeter, etc. 

## Lessons Learned

Have a post-incident meeting where everyone affected by the incident gathers around to discuss how to resolve the issue more efficiently next time. These meetings should be done as soon as possible after the incident has been dealt with. 

Questions must be asked and answered during these meetings: what happened and at what time? How did the incident handling plan work? What can be done differently next time?  What indicators are to be watched more closely next time?
