Internet of Things (IoT) devices might be vulnerable for attacks. 

Firmware is the software inside of hardware devices. Vendors are the only ones who can fix their hardware.

Some of these hardware devices can reach their End of Life (EOL). That means the manufacturer will stop selling the product. 

End of Service Lief (EOSL) is when a hardware stops getting further support from the manufacturer. The firmware will be vulnerable from now on due to lack of patches.
