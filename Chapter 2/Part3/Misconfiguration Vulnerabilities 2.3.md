Leaving data open to the public or securing it with weak passwords is type of misconfiguration. For example, if Linux root account has a weak password, an attacker can easily guess the password of the user and have root privileges. 

## Insecure Protocols

Some protocols aren't encrypted and send traffic in clear text: Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP. Instead, the encrypted versions of these protocols should always be used: SSH, SFTP,IMAPS, etc
