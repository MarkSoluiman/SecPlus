## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

This part of segmentation. These lists include groupings of categories like Source IP, Destination IP, port number, time of day, application, etc.

These lists also determine access to network devices. They can limit access by IP address or other identifier. Prevent regular user /non-admin access.

Many operating systems use ACLs to provide access to files.

## Allow and Deny Lists

As it was discussed before, these lists control what applications or files can be run on an OS. 

The decision is made in the operating system according to different criteria: Only allow applications with a unique hash identifier, allow digitally signed apps from certain publishers, only run applications in specific folders, specific apps can only run from specific network zones.
