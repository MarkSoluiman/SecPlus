To spot a phishing email or message, always check the URL link that you are being asked to click. Check for spelling mistakes or inconsistency in fonts or graphics being used.

Attackers might use legit emails of employees within an organization to spoof their email. 

Attackers might use typos to appear as a legit user or sender of an email. For example, an attacker might send you an email with the sender of: paypel.com . Or, the attacker will try to click on this link: `https://www.paypel.com`. Notice how close the spelling is to Paypal. This is called **Typosquatting**.
